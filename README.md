# Galois Theory for Rats 🧀
> Accessible, engaging Galois Theory for everyone. Now also for humans.
>
 ## 📚 Overview
 This repository contains a series of handouts and handwritten notes on **Galois Theory**, the beautiful, profound branch of abstract algebra that sparked off
 modern mathematics. From field extensions to the insolvability of the quintic and the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, this series is intended for any math 
 enthusiast, typically at the high school or undergraduate level.

 ## 🧠 Prerequisites

- Basic group theory (what a group is, homomorphisms)
- Ring and field definitions
- Polynomials over fields (irreducibility, degrees)
- Linear algebra (vector spaces, bases) – helpful but not required
- All proofs more complex than what a rat is capable of understanding is skippable, intuition & interest >> rigor
